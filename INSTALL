Directions for installing Nemesis on Windows systems are at the bottom of this 
file.

Installing Nemesis on UNIX-like systems:
========================================

Installing Nemesis on UNIX-like systems is a straightforward process that 
closely resembles installing any other piece of software using GNU autotools.  
Before attempting to install Nemesis, ensure that libnet-1.0.2a is installed.

The following steps are all that is needed to compile and install Nemesis:
1. ./configure
2. make
3. make install
4. examine the nemesis man pages
5. enjoy.

When compiling the following switches are available:
----------------------------------------------------

`--enable-debug'
     Enable debugging options (bugreports and developers only).

`--enable-profile'
     Enable code profiling options (developers only).

`--with-libnet-includes=DIR'
     If the configuration script can't find the libnet include files on its
     own, the path can be set manually with this switch.  Do not include
     a trailing / when specifying the include path. 

     Example:

     --with-libnet-includes=/usr/local/libnet/include

`--with-libnet-libraries=DIR'
     If the configuration script can't find the libnet library files on its
     own, the path can be set manually with this switch.  Do not include
     a trailing / when specifying the library path.

     Example:

     --with-libnet-libraries=/usr/local/libnet/lib


Installing Nemesis on Windows systems:
======================================

nemesis.exe can be installed anywhere on a Windows system.  The caveat is 
that LibnetNT.dll must exist either in the same directory as nemesis.exe or
in any of the directories listed in the %PATH% variable.  On Windows 2000
this would be %SystemRoot%\System32

Luckily, the nemesis zip file contains LibnetNT.dll inside the 'nemesis'
directory which should allow you to begin using Nemesis immediately.
